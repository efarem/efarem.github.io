Since 2009 I've been working as lead engineer and mentor at a <a href="http://www.digital-results.com" target="_blank">web development agency</a> in Hertfordshire...

I've worked on an enormous number of websites & mobile applications most of which aren't publicly available... But some are including <a href="http://www.dentistry.co.uk" target="_blank">Dentistry.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.dentistryod.com" target="_blank">Dentistry on Demand</a>, <a href="http://www.lawmanager.co.uk" target="_blank">Law Manager</a> & <a href="http://www.tweetshow.co.uk" target="_blank">Tweet Show</a>.

Every day I build and maintain apps with `PHP/JavaScript` using `Angular/Laravel` with `Git/GitLab` for source control and `Ansible` for deployment.
